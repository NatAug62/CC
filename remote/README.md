# CC

## Attempted Refactor
You may notice there is only one C file in this folder. All the code for this portion of the program is in that one file. I tried reorganizing the code across multiple files, each corresponding to a single feature, but this was incredibly difficult and never really worked. I did try starting from scratch, rewriting all the code but organizing it into different source files as I wrote it. However, I got burnt out and stopped this reorganization fairly early in the process.
